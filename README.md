# TSMapper

TypeScript utility library to ease object mapping.
Websites, mobile applications and others developed using TypeScript more and more consist of similar but different object models. One will easily endup loading data from diferent sources, like databases and services, where the data in two models may be similar but having diferent structure. TSMapper mapping makes it easy to convert between different models, allowing them to remain segregated.
